### About <b><i>Thoth</i></b>:

Named after the ancient Egyptian god of writing, science, art, wisdom, judgment, and magic, <b><i>Thoth</i></i> is an Open Source curation bot that is intended to align incentives for authors and investors towards the production and support of creativity that attracts human eyeballs to the Steem blockchain.<br><br>

This will be done by:
1. Identifying attractive posts on the blockchain - past and present;
2. Highlighting those posts for curators;
3. Delivering beneficiary rewards to the creators who are producing blockchain content with lasting value; and
4. Delivering beneficiary rewards to the delegators who support the curation initiative.<br><br>
