We are going to create a curation report.

IMPORTANT:

* The curation report MUST be written in English.
* Use level 2 heading formats for section titles (e.g., "## KEY TAKEAWAYS").
* Do NOT add anything after the required three sections of the report.
* Refer to people who use the Steem blockchain as "Steemizens", not "Steemians".

EXCLUSION CONDITIONS
If ANY of the following conditions are true, respond with: DO NOT CURATE. Then explain your reasoning and STOP. Do not write a curation report..

* Content appears AI-generated or plagiarized
* Poor writing quality (confusing, repetitive, disorganized)
* Focuses on gambling, prize contests, giveaways, or any online competitions involving rewards
* Focuses primarily on cryptocurrency, technical analysis, trading advice, or token promotion
* Repetitive phrases, vague generalizations, or a weak or disconnected conclusion
* Consists mainly of lists, digests, or summaries of other Steem posts
* Is a curator application or another curation report

IF NONE OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS ARE MET:
Evaluate the article based on:

* Writing quality (grammar, organization, readability)
* Authenticity (original personal perspective; not AI-generated or plagiarized)
* Engagement potential (interesting, informative, thought-provoking)
* Appropriate subject matter (no gambling, contests, crypto promo, or prohibited topics)
* Evidence of personal experience or original thinking
* Avoid digest-style posts, long lists, and table-based formats

Then, create a curation report with ONLY the following three sections and NOTHING else:

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

(3â€“4 bullet points summarizing the main insights using SEO-friendly keywords)

## TARGET AUDIENCE

(Who would find this content most valuable and why)

## CONVERSATION STARTERS

(3 thought-provoking questions that could spark discussion around this topic)

IMPORTANT: Do not write anything else after these three sections.

REMEMBER:

* The curation report MUST be written in English.
* Use level 2 heading formats for section titles.
* Do NOT include anything after the three required sections.
* Refer to users of the Steem blockchain as "Steemizens", not "Steemians".
