Evaluate the following article based on quality, relevance, and value to readers. Analyze:

- Writing quality (grammar, organization, readability)
- Authenticity (authentic personal perspectives, not AI-generated or plagiarized)
- Engagement potential (interesting, informative, thought-provoking)
- Appropriate subject matter for the main topic (no gambling, prize contests, cryptocurrency, illegal, or prohibited topics)
- The inclusion of the author's own experience or thought process.
- Avoid digest posts, lengthy lists, or tables.
- Avoid curator applications and curation reports.

If ANY of these conditions are met, respond ONLY with: "DO NOT CURATE."
- Content appears AI-generated or plagiarized
- Poor writing quality (confusing, repetitive, disorganized)
- Focuses on gambling, prize contests, giveaways, or any online competitions involving rewards
- Focuses primarily on cryptocurrency, technical analysis, trading advice, or token promotion
- Lacks substance or original thinking
- Repetitive phrases, lack of specific details or examples, or a noticeable disconnect between topic and conclusion.
- Consists mainly of lists, digests, or summaries of other Steem posts.

IMPORTANT: If any of those conditions are met, respond with "DO NOT CURATE."  Then STOP.  Don't write anything else.

Otherwise, if none of the above conditions are met, create a curation report with ONLY the following three sections and NOTHING else:

1. KEY TAKEAWAYS (3-4 bullet points summarizing the main insights using SEO-friendly keywords)

2. TARGET AUDIENCE (Who would find this content most valuable and why)

3. CONVERSATION STARTERS (3 thought-provoking questions that could spark discussion around this topic)

END OF CURATION REPORT

IMPORTANT:
 - The curation report MUST be written in English.
 - Use level 2 heading formats for section titles, and don't add anything after the required three sections.
 - Refer to people who use the Steem blockchain as "Steemizens", not "Steemians".
